# Forum Module ‚Äì Detailed MVP Completion Plan

> **Goal**: Complete the Forum Module to MVP standard. Codex must execute each task and check off the checklist. The module is considered complete when **all items are checked**.

---

## üéØ Purpose

The Forum Module provides community discussion functionality: threads, posts, voting (upvotes), reporting (abuse/moderation), basic moderation tools, list filtering and sorting, thread view with pagination, thread creation with first post, locked thread handling, and client-side compliance with Firestore security rules.

---

## üß† Development Tasks

The following tasks are organized by priority. Each task has **completion criteria**. Codex should check off the checklist after successful implementation and validation.

### P0 ‚Äì Critical (MVP blockers)

* [x] **Bind real Auth UID for all operations**
  Replace all hardcoded userIds with the Firebase Auth UID. Ensure Firestore writes only send allowed fields per rules.
  **Done when**: All writes succeed on emulator without `permission-denied`.

* [x] **Wire UI actions in Thread View**
  Implement Reply, Add Comment, Edit (owner), Delete (owner), Upvote, Report buttons. Add optimistic updates + error handling.
  **Done when**: All icons trigger correct behavior with feedback.

* [x] **New Thread creation flow**
  Add validation (title, first post, type). Navigate to thread view after success.
  **Done when**: Invalid inputs show errors, success redirects to thread with first post visible.

* [x] **Forum FAB navigation**
  Connect FAB on Forum list to New Thread screen.
  **Done when**: Clicking FAB opens new thread form.

* [x] **Firestore rules alignment**
  Ensure all client JSON structures align with Firestore rules. Expand rule tests.
  **Done when**: Rules tests pass (positive/negative), emulator shows no rejection.

* [x] **Locked threads handling**
  Respect `locked` field: disable composer and show message.
  **Done when**: Locked thread blocks posting, clear feedback visible.

### P1 ‚Äì Important (MVP polish)

* [x] **Infinite scroll & pagination**
  Load more threads/posts at scroll end, add loading footer, prevent duplicates.
  **Done when**: Smooth scroll loads, no duplicate entries.

* [x] **Filtering & sorting**
  Implement All/Matches/General/Pinned + Latest/Newest/Activity combinations. Unit test query builder.
  **Done when**: Filters and sorts return correct results.

* [x] **Firestore indexes**
  Update `firestore.indexes.json` for all queries.
  **Done when**: No missing index errors in emulator.

* [ ] **Thread aggregate fields**
  Maintain `lastActivityAt` and `postCount` on create/delete.
  **Done when**: Ordering and counts are correct.

### P2 ‚Äì Quality & Moderation

* [ ] **Report flow**
  Implement report form, save Firestore document, show confirmation.
  **Done when**: Report works end-to-end, user sees feedback.

* [ ] **Upvote state and counter**
  Show per-user upvote state + total count, optimistic updates, idempotent behavior.
  **Done when**: Upvote count correct, no double increments.

* [ ] **Edit/Delete own posts**
  Add Edit dialog + Delete confirmation, owner-only access.
  **Done when**: Owners can edit/delete, rules respected.

### P3 ‚Äì Testing & Dev Experience

* [ ] **End-to-end integration test**
  Full path: Login ‚Üí New Thread ‚Üí First Post ‚Üí List ‚Üí Open Thread ‚Üí Comment ‚Üí Upvote ‚Üí Report.
  **Done when**: Test green locally and in CI.

* [ ] **Extended rules testing**
  Cover owner vs non-owner, locked vs unlocked, whitelist violations, etc.
  **Done when**: Extended rules test suite passes.

* [ ] **Localization updates (HU/EN/DE)**
  Externalize all new strings (errors, forms, snackbars), update ARB files, regenerate l10n.
  **Done when**: ARB files updated, build passes, translations complete.

---

## üß™ Test Status

* Current: unit and widget tests exist, rules tests basic.
* Missing: full e2e happy-path, extended rules, pagination/filter tests.
* Critical: Ensure client JSON exactly matches rules; otherwise regressions occur.

---

## üåç Localization

* Target languages: **HU/EN/DE**.
* Work: add new keys for actions, errors, validation, and feedback.

---

## üìé Dependencies

* **Firebase/Firestore**: collections (`threads`, `posts`, `votes`, `reports`), indexes, rules.
* **Auth**: required for write operations, owner validation.
* **CI**: must run emulator tests (rules + integration).
* **Moderation**: report schema compatible with future admin tools.

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done

1. All P0‚ÄìP3 checklist items checked.
2. All tests (unit, widget, integration, rules) pass in CI.
3. Manual emulator run works (thread ‚Üí post ‚Üí upvote ‚Üí report ‚Üí locked thread).
4. No missing index errors.
5. Localization build passes without errors.
