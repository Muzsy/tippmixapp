      Create `test/screens/badge_screen_test.dart` based on the nine test‑cases (TC‑01…TC‑09) in the canvas.
      * Wrap the widget under test in a `ProviderScope` that overrides `userBadgesProvider` with a mock `Stream` controller.
      * Build the widget inside a `MaterialApp` configured with the three supported locales.
      * Implement the grid, filter, scroll and localization assertions.
      * Mark TC‑05 and TC‑06 with `skip` because the modal dialog and Hero animation are not yet implemented in the production code.
      * Do **NOT** execute the tests – CI will run `dart run test`.
    output: test/screens/badge_screen_test.dart
    run_tests: false
