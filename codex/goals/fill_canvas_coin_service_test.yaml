  - lib/services/coin_service.dart
  - lib/utils/cache.dart              # balance cache util, if present
  - lib/providers/coin_provider.dart  # provider exposing balance
  - lib/utils/payment_gateway.dart    # wrapper around payment API, if present
steps:
  - name: Generate unit tests for CoinService
    description: >
      Create `test/services/coin_service_test.dart` that implements all use‑cases
      from the canvas (cache‑hit, cache‑miss, successful purchase, declined
      purchase, network retry). Use a FakeHttpClient from `http/testing.dart`, a
      FakeBalanceCache (Map‑based) and a mock payment gateway. Inject
      dependencies through the CoinService constructor or provider overrides.
      Do NOT execute the tests here – the CI pipeline will run `dart run test`.
