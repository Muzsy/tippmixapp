lib/utils/cache.dart          # memory cache util, if present

steps:
name: Generate unit tests for OddsApiService
description: >
Create test/services/odds_api_service_test.dart that implements all five use‑cases listed in the canvas:
cache‑hit, cache‑miss, retry‑success, retry‑failure, rate‑limit.
Use a mock HTTP client from http/testing.dart, an in‑memory FakeCache, and package:clock to control time.
Do NOT attempt to run the tests in the Codex container. The CI pipeline will execute them later in a Dart/Flutter‑enabled environment.     ≥ 90 %, az összes negatív ág assertálva.
