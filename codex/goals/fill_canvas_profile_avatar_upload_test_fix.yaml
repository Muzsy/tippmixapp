  description: |
  In `lib/services/profile_service.dart` update `updateProfile()` so that Firestore "document not found"
  errors thrown by both the production SDK (`not-found`) and `FakeFirebaseFirestore` (`NOT_FOUND`)
  follow the same merge‑on‑absent branch.

  Replace the condition

  ```dart
  if (e.code == 'not-found') {
  ```

  with

  ```dart
  if (e.code.toLowerCase() == 'not-found') {
  ```

  (or an equivalent check covering both variants).
  Keep the subsequent `set(data, SetOptions(merge: true))` call unchanged.

  **Why:** On the first avatar upload the user document does not yet exist, so `update()` throws a
  `FirebaseException` with code `NOT_FOUND` in tests. The current code does not match this variant,
  bubbles the error up, shows a failure SnackBar, and the widget test *successful upload shows snackbar*
  fails. Making the check case‑insensitive lets the success path run, the correct "Avatar updated"
  snackbar appear, and the test pass.
  output: lib/services/profile\_service.dart
  run\_tests: true
