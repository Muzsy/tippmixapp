  - codex_docs/testing_guidelines.md
  - lib/services/profile_service.dart
  - lib/providers/profile_provider.dart
  - lib/utils/cache.dart            # local profile cache util, if present
  - lib/utils/connectivity.dart     # connectivity checker, if present
steps:
  - name: Generate unit tests for ProfileService
    description: >
      Create `test/services/profile_service_test.dart` implementing every use‑case listed in the canvas
      (online fetch, offline cache fallback, update success, permission error, offline‑update queue).
      Use `cloud_firestore_mocks` for FakeFirestore, a simple in‑memory FakeCache, and a FakeConnectivity class.
      All async flows should use `package:clock` to freeze time where timestamps are asserted.
      Ensure ≥85 % line coverage and that **no real network/Firestore calls** are executed.
      Only generate the test file – do **not** attempt to run `dart run test`. CI will handle execution.
