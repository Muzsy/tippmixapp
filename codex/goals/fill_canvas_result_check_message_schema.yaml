goal: "Result-check message schema: per-fixture finalize payload"
owner: platform
source_docs:
  - codex/MD/match_finalizer_scaling_tasks.md
  - docs/backend/data_model_en.md
acceptance:
  - Upstream publishes {type: "finalize", fixtureId: "<id>"} to topic RESULT_CHECK
  - match_finalizer parses fixtureId and runs fixture-mode path
  - DLQ/retry preserved; attempt attribute incremented
  - Backward compatibility: legacy job-mode still works
steps:
  - Define topic name(s) in env (RESULT_TOPIC, DLQ_TOPIC)
  - Update upstream producer to emit one message per finished fixture
  - Document example payloads and attributes in docs/backend/data_model_en.md
  - Add integration note in cloud_functions README (optional)
out_of_scope:
  - Producer service deployment (handled in upstream repo)
