# üö¶ Priority & Severity Rules

> **Purpose**
> Provide a unified scale so Codex and human developers triage issues the same way, ensuring the most business‚Äëcritical bugs are fixed first.

## Priority Matrix

| Level  | Label                      | Criteria                                                                                                         | Expected Fix SLA                    |
| ------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **P0** | **Critical¬†/¬†App‚Äëblocker** | ‚Ä¢ Application crashes on launch  <br>‚Ä¢ Data loss or corruption  <br>‚Ä¢ Security breach with live exploit          | **Immediately** (‚â§¬†2¬†hours)         |
| **P1** | **High**                   | ‚Ä¢ Core feature unusable (e.g. cannot place bet)  <br>‚Ä¢ No viable workaround  <br>‚Ä¢ Performance degradation >50¬†% | **Within 24¬†h**                     |
| **P2** | **Medium**                 | ‚Ä¢ Feature partially broken but workaround exists  <br>‚Ä¢ Minor performance issue  <br>‚Ä¢ Incorrect translation     | **Next sprint**                     |
| **P3** | **Low**                    | ‚Ä¢ Cosmetic UI glitch  <br>‚Ä¢ Copy change  <br>‚Ä¢ Non‚Äëblocking suggestion                                           | **Backlog** (when capacity permits) |

> **Note**: Timeframes reference business hours in the Europe/Budapest timezone.

## Workflow Rules

1. **Reporter responsibility** ‚Äì Tag the ticket with an initial priority (`P?`) based on the matrix above.
2. **Triage meeting** ‚Äì Product Owner + Tech Lead confirm or adjust the priority within 24¬†h.
3. **Escalation path** ‚Äì Any team member may escalate a bug one level up with justification; Tech Lead has final say.
4. **SLA tracking** ‚Äì CI pipeline auto‚Äëlabels PRs that fix `P0/P1` issues; failing SLA triggers a red status in Slack.

| Odds refresh freezes for 3‚Äë4¬†s but betting still possible | **P1**          | Core feature impacted, poor UX |
| Dutch translation for ‚ÄúStake‚Äù is wrong                    | **P2**          | Minor content error            |
| Padding misaligned on Settings icon                       | **P3**          | Purely cosmetic                |
