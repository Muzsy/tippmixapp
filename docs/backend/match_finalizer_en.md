# ðŸ§® match_finalizer Cloud Function (EN)

Background worker processing `result-check` Pub/Sub messages. Its responsibilities:

1. Decode job type (`kickoff-tracker`, `result-poller`, `final-sweep`).
2. Query pending tickets from the root `tickets` collection and gather `eventId`s from each ticket's `tips[]` array.
3. Fetch scores via `ResultProvider`, which now returns the `winner` and treats `FT/AET/PEN` as completed.
4. Evaluate each ticket's tips (mapping `marketKey`, `outcome`, `odds`) and, once none remain `pending`, execute a Firestore **transaction** that:
   - computes payout via `calcTicketPayout`,
   - updates ticket `status`, `payout` and `processedAt`,
   - credits the user's `balance` atomically.
   Idempotency is enforced by checking `processedAt`.
5. Future step: create `notifications/{uid}` document and send FCM push.

This document covers the TypeScript skeleton with atomic payout handling.

**Runtime**: Node.js 20 on 2nd gen Cloud Functions.
