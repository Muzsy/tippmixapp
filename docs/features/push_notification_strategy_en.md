# 🔔 Push Notification Strategy (EN)

This document outlines the plan for implementing push notifications in TippmixApp.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Notify users about key events
- Increase engagement and retention
- Drive return visits to the app

---

## 🔧 Tools

- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**
- `firebase_messaging` Flutter package
- Optional backend: Cloud Functions for FCM send

---

## 📋 Notification Types

- ✅ Bet result: “Your ticket won/lost!”
- 🏆 Badge earned: “New badge unlocked!”
- 🔔 Inactivity: “Haven’t seen you in a while!”
- 📈 Weekly summary (planned)
- 💬 New forum reply (future)

---

## 📱 UI & UX

- `NotificationIcon` with unread indicator
- Notification permission prompt on first use
- Tap opens relevant screen (ticket, badge, thread)

---

## 🔐 Security / Privacy

- Only server can send notifications
- No personal data in payload
- Token stored in user profile (optional)

---

## 🧪 Testing Plan

- Firebase Emulator Suite for local testing
- `flutter_local_notifications` for foreground display
- End-to-end test: send + receive + display
